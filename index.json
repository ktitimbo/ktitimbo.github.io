However, the theoretical predictions do not match the experimental observation well. Here, we numerically solve the standard quantum mechanical model, via the von Neumann equation, that includes the hyperfine interaction for the time evolution of the spin. The outcome is compared with the experimental observation and the predictions by Majorana, Rabi, and an alternative model called co-quantum dynamics. Thus far, the coefficients of determination from the standard quantum mechanical model, which does not use free parameters, are still below zero. Non-standard variants that improve the match are explored for discussion.","tags":["Majorana transitions","Electron spin","quantum dynamics"],"title":"Quantum mechanical modeling of the multi-stage Stern‚ÄìGerlach experiment by Frisch and Segr√® using the von Neumann equation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Z.

The main experimental results given by Chaibi et al. (EPL, 82 (2008) 20005) have been reproduced using the closed-orbit theory, and confirmed through the quantum source theory with the energy Green function evaluated by means of the stationary phase approximation. Both theoretical methods yield consistent descriptions of the electron flux distribution for all field intensities and angular momentum of electrons we studied. Our calculations show that the presence of the magnetic field leads to a global displacement of the ring patterns along the $\\vec{E}\\times\\vec{B}$ -direction, confirming the experimental observations under weak magnetic-field conditions. In addition, we found that the shape and size of the interference patterns change from circular to elliptical as the magnetic field increases.","tags":["Semiclassical Approximation","Photodetachment Microscopy"],"title":"Theoretical studies of the effects of a transverse magnetic field in photodetachment microscopy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["F.

The experimental noise, which unavoidably affects the homodyne data, leads to a detection efficiency $\\eta \u003c 1$. The problem of reconstructing quantum states from noisy homodyne data sets prompted an intense scientific debate about the presence or absence of a lower homodyne efficiency bound ($\\eta \u003e 0.5$) below which quantum features, like quantum interferences, cannot be retrieved. Here, by numerical experiments, we demonstrate that quantum interferences can be effectively reconstructed also for low homodyne detection efficiency. In particular, we address the challenging case of a Schr√∂dinger cat state and test the minimax and adaptive Wigner function reconstruction technique by processing homodyne data distributed according to the chosen state but with an efficiency $\\eta \u003c 0.5$. By numerically reproducing the Schr√∂dinger's cat interference pattern, we give evidence that quantum state reconstruction is actually possible in these conditions, and provide a guideline for handling optical tomography based on homodyne data collected by low efficiency detectors.","tags":null,"title":"Quantum interferences reconstruction with low homodyne detection efficiency","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

Their measurement in solids is the subject of an intense scientific debate focused on seeking a methodology capable of establishing a direct link between the variance of the atomic displacements and experimentally measurable observables. Here we address this issue by means of non-equilibrium optical experiments performed in shot-noise-limited regime. The variance of the time-dependent atomic positions and momenta is directly mapped into the quantum fluctuations of the photon number of the scattered probing light. A fully quantum description of the non-linear interaction between photonic and phononic fields is benchmarked by unveiling the squeezing of thermal phonons in $\\alpha$-quartz.","tags":null,"title":"Photon number statistics uncover the fluctuations in non-equilibrium lattice dynamics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kelvin Titimbo","Robert Ford"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

So far, only semiclassical methods have been employed in order to theoretically interpret the experimental data. In contrast, a fully quantum treatment will be presented here taking into account the quantum features of the generation mechanism of excited phonons by pump laser pulses, and of the process of accessing their behaviour by probe laser pulses. A single effective Hamiltonian will be used to model the interaction between photons and phonons both for the pumping and probing processes. In addition, as they interact with their environment, mainly electrons in the target, the excited phonons cannot be considered an isolated system. Their dynamics is then that typical of open quantum systems and generated by a master equation of Lindblad form, that takes into account the dissipative and noisy effects due to the environment. In this formalism, phonon oscillations can be analysed through suitable probe photon observables. Specifically, unlike in the existing literature, we will not focus only upon the scattered probe pulse intensity, namely on the probe photon number, but also on the number variance. Through the latter some quantum features of the phonon state can be accessed; in particular, specific signals of the presence of squeezed phonons can thus be identified.","tags":["Open Quantum Systems","Quantum Optics","Ultrafast Optical Excitations"],"title":"Creation and detection of squeezed phonons in pump and probe experiments: a fully quantum treatment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

Here, it is shown that the presence of low detection efficiency ($\u003c50%$ ) does not prevent the tomographic reconstruction of quantum states of light, specifically, of Gaussian states. This result is obtained by applying the so-called ‚Äòminimax‚Äô adaptive reconstruction of the Wigner function to pulsed homodyne detection. In particular, we prove, by both numerical and real experiments, that an effective discrimination of different Gaussian quantum states can be achieved. Our finding paves the way to a more extensive use of quantum tomographic methods, even in physical situations in which high detection efficiency is unattainable.","tags":["Quantum Optics"],"title":"Pulsed homodyne Gaussian quantum tomography with low detection efficiency","type":"publication"},{"authors":["F.

In the following, we review two different approaches to the entanglement of systems consisting of two bosons or fermions; the first approach is based on the particle aspect typical of first quantization and identifies separable pure states as those that allow to assign two orthogonal single particle vector states to both parties. The second approach makes full use of the mode aspect of second quantization whereby separability can be formulated as absence of nonlocal correlation among two different sets of modes. While the first approach applies to pure states only, the second one is more general and characterizes generic entangled states. In the following, we shall show that the mode-based approach indeed contains the particle-based one.","tags":null,"title":"Entanglement of Identical Particles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kelvin Titimbo","Robert Ford"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.
