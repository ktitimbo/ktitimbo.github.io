abstract: "We use a new theory termed co-quantum dynamics (CQD) to numerically model spin flip in the multi-stage Stern–Gerlach (SG) experiment conducted by R. Frisch and E. Segrè. This experiment consists of two Stern–Gerlach apparatuses separated by an inner rotation chamber that varies the fraction of spin flip. To this day, quantum mechanical treatments inadequately predict the Frisch–Segrè experiment. Here, we account for electron-nuclear interactions according to CQD and solve the associated Schrödinger equation. Our simulation outcome agrees with the Frisch–Segrè experimental observation and supports CQD as a potential model for electron spin evolution and collapse."
