abstract: "The multi-stage Stern–Gerlach experiment conducted by Frisch and Segrè has been modeled analytically using quantum mechanics by Majorana and revised by Rabi by including the hyperfine interaction. However, the theoretical predictions do not match the experimental observation well. Here, we numerically solve the standard quantum mechanical model, via the von Neumann equation, that includes the hyperfine interaction for the time evolution of the spin. The outcome is compared with the experimental observation and the predictions by Majorana, Rabi, and an alternative model called co-quantum dynamics. Thus far, the coefficients of determination from the standard quantum mechanical model, which does not use free parameters, are still below zero. Non-standard variants that improve the match are explored for discussion."
